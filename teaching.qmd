I teach a mix of data science and math courses Seattle University-- my main emphasis is in the MS Data Science program. In all my classes, I place a strong emphasis on critical thinking, applying knowledge to real-world problems, and communication skills. I wrote an [article in COMAP's GAIMME Time](https://www.comap.com/membership/member-resources/item/gaimme-time-getting-away-from-one-right-answer?highlight=WyJtZW5kaWJsZSJd) (Guidelines for Assessment and Instruction in Mathematical Modeling Education) column about these goals. 

If you teach similar courses and would like to share resources and ideas, please get in touch!
