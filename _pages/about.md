I am currently an Assistant Professor of Mathematics at Seattle University. 

I recently completed my PhD in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Washington, co-advised by [Steve Brunton](https://www.eigensteve.com/) and [Nathan Kutz](http://faculty.washington.edu/kutz/).

My work focused on developing methods to improve reduced order models for systems with underlying symmetries. Moving forward, I am interested in applying my modeling and data science knowledge to applications of social justice.

Please see my publications and talks for a closer look into my work.
